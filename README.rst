Features
--------

This hook saves developers time by prepending ticket numbers to commit-msgs.
For this to work the following two conditions must be met:
   - The ticket format regex specified must match, if the regex is passed in.
   - The branch name format must be <ticket number>_<rest of the branch name>

For e.g. if you name your branch ``JIRA-1234_awesome_feature`` and commit ``Fix some bug``, the commit will be updated to ``JIRA-1234 Fix some bug``.

Pass ``--regex=`` or update ``args: [--regex=<custom regex>]`` in your .yaml file if you have custom ticket regex.
By default it's ``[A-Z]+-\d+``.

Pass ``--format=`` or update ``args: [--format=<custom template string>]`` in your .yaml file if you have custom message replacement.
By default it's ``'{ticket} {commit_msg}``, where ``ticket`` is replaced with the found ticket number and ``commit_msg`` is replaced with the original commit message.


It is best used along with pre-commit_. You can use it along with pre-commit by adding the following hook in your ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` file.
